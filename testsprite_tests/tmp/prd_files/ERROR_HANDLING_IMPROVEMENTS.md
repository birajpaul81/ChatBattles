# Error Handling Improvements

## Overview

Enhanced error handling system with automatic retry logic and graceful degradation for vision models.

## Features

### 1. **Automatic Retry for Vision Models**

When a vision model (GPT-5-Nano, Gemini 2.5) fails with a 500 error while processing images:

1. **First Attempt** - Try with images in multimodal format
2. **If 500 Error** - Automatically retry with text-only (strip images)
3. **Success** - Return response with warning about image unavailability
4. **Failure** - Return user-friendly error message

### 2. **Better Error Messages**

Instead of cryptic error codes, users now see:

| Error Type | User-Friendly Message |
|------------|----------------------|
| 500 Internal Server Error | "The AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again." |
| 429 Rate Limit | "Rate limit reached. Please wait a moment and try again." |
| Timeout | "Request timed out. The model may be overloaded." |
| Other | Original error message |

### 3. **Graceful Degradation**

When image processing fails:
- Vision models fall back to text-only mode
- Response includes warning: "⚠️ Image processing temporarily unavailable"
- User still gets a response instead of complete failure
- Other models continue working normally

## Implementation

### Retry Logic for Vision Models

```typescript
try {
  // Try with images
  const completion = await a4fClient.chat.completions.create({
    model: modelInfo.id,
    messages: modelMessages, // Contains multimodal content
  });
} catch (apiError) {
  if (modelInfo.supportsVision && hasImages && apiError.status === 500) {
    // Retry without images
    const textOnlyMessages = stripImages(modelMessages);
    const retryCompletion = await a4fClient.chat.completions.create({
      model: modelInfo.id,
      messages: textOnlyMessages,
    });
    
    return {
      text: `⚠️ Image processing temporarily unavailable. Text response:\n\n${response}`
    };
  }
}
```

### Error Message Mapping

```typescript
let errorMessage = "Failed to get response";

if (error.status === 500) {
  errorMessage = "The AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again.";
} else if (error.status === 429) {
  errorMessage = "Rate limit reached. Please wait a moment and try again.";
} else if (error.code === 'ECONNABORTED' || error.code === 'ETIMEDOUT') {
  errorMessage = "Request timed out. The model may be overloaded.";
}
```

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Gemini Image Processing Fails

**Before:**
```
Error: 500 An unexpected error occurred on our server.
```

**After:**
```
⚠️ Image processing temporarily unavailable. Text response:

I can help you with your question! While I couldn't process 
the image this time, I can still assist with text-based tasks...
```

### Scenario 2: Rate Limit Hit

**Before:**
```
Error: Failed to get response
```

**After:**
```
⚠️ Error: Rate limit reached. Please wait a moment and try again.
```

### Scenario 3: Timeout

**Before:**
```
Error: Failed to get response
```

**After:**
```
⚠️ Error: Request timed out. The model may be overloaded.
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Reliability** - Automatic retries prevent complete failures
2. **User-Friendly** - Clear, actionable error messages
3. **Graceful Degradation** - Users still get responses even when features fail
4. **Transparency** - Users know what went wrong and what to do
5. **Resilience** - System continues working even when one model fails

## Error Flow Diagram

```
User uploads image + prompt
         ↓
Try vision model with image
         ↓
    [Success?]
    ↙        ↘
  Yes         No (500 error)
   ↓           ↓
Return      Retry without image
response         ↓
            [Success?]
            ↙        ↘
          Yes         No
           ↓           ↓
    Return with    Return
    warning      error message
```

## Testing

To test error handling:

1. **Upload image** - Should work normally
2. **If Gemini fails** - Should retry without image and show warning
3. **Check error messages** - Should be user-friendly, not technical
4. **Other models** - Should continue working even if one fails

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: Gemini 500 Errors with Images

**Cause:** Gemini API may have temporary issues with multimodal content

**Workaround:** 
- System automatically retries without images
- User gets text response with warning
- Can try again later when service recovers

### Issue: Rate Limiting

**Cause:** Too many requests in short time

**Solution:**
- Clear error message tells user to wait
- Can implement request queuing in future
- Consider adding rate limit indicators

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Request queuing system
- [ ] Rate limit indicators in UI
- [ ] Automatic model fallback (if GPT-5 fails, try Gemini)
- [ ] Error analytics dashboard
- [ ] User notification system for service status

## Monitoring

Errors are logged with:
- Model ID
- Error type
- Error message
- Retry attempts
- Final outcome
