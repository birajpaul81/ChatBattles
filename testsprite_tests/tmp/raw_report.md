## 2️⃣ Requirement Validation Summary

#### Test TC001
- **Test Name:** User sign-up with valid credentials
- **Test Code:** [TC001_User_sign_up_with_valid_credentials.py](./TC001_User_sign_up_with_valid_credentials.py)

#### Test TC002
- **Test Name:** User sign-up with existing email
- **Test Code:** [TC002_User_sign_up_with_existing_email.py](./TC002_User_sign_up_with_existing_email.py)
- **Test Error:** The sign-up attempt with an already registered email failed as expected, but the error message shown is about failed security validations rather than indicating the email is already in use. This does not fully meet the test requirement to verify the appropriate error message for an already registered email. Test concluded with this observation.
